## Machine Learning Project: Boston Housing Median House Value Prediction

![Boston Housing Image][image1]

## General Project Details

## Proposal and Final Project Paper

Problem Statement: The aim is to accurately predict the median housing values using machine learning algorithms.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluation metrics will be using r-squared for this regression task. Rather than using RMSE or MSE, r-squared is interpretable and common.

## Requirements
See the requirements.txt file for necessary packages. 

## Data
See directories "images" for supporting data.

## Outputs

The jupyter notebook will house all data and outputs.

## Motivation
  
Fun project to practice various machine learning algorithms.

## General Deployment Details

TBD
