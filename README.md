## Machine Learning Project: Boston Housing Median House Value Prediction

![Boston Housing Image][image1]

## Deployment Details

The project is actively deployed on Heroku at the following link: https://boston-housing-data-prediction.herokuapp.com/

## General Project Details

## Proposal and Final Project Paper

Problem Statement: The aim is to accurately predict the median housing values using machine learning algorithms.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluation metrics will be using r-squared for this regression task. Rather than using RMSE or MSE, r-squared is interpretable and common.

## Requirements
See the requirements.txt file for necessary packages. 

## Data
See directories "static/images" for supporting data.

## Outputs

The jupyter notebook will house all data, and contain code for creating all model outputs.
The "app.py" file contains the flask application code, using the HTML templates, saved models, and stored (pickled) data.

## Motivation
  
Fun project to practice various machine learning algorithms.
